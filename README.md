## 💻 About

An online system for managing the location of street potholes with everything automated by microcontrollers!

## 🤯 Learnings

Aut Dec was a hard project for me, since it was the first time I was coding an app that needed to consume a api server, but I challenged myself to do it.

In this project, a system for managing the location of street potholes was created, the idea was that microcontrollers installed in vehicles were going to register the location of a pothole whenever the vehicle passed over one and send this information to a server, that later would be accessed by a web client for consulting these locations and managing the microcontrollers.

At the end of the project, I was able to say that I created a whole web system that consumed an api providing many features, including user authentication and interactions with the system database. It was a really nice experience and I would love to work in more challenging projects like this.
